					<h2>Martial Arts - Taekwondo</h2>
					<p>I attended Yun’s Black Belt Academy earning my Cho Dan Bo first 
					probationary black belt in 1990 which allowed me to train for the next

					inherited the Academy from my Master instructor and re-organized it as

					The Academy prospered and grew over the next 18 years into 121 full time martial arts 
					students ranging in rank from White to 2nd Black belts. Studnets ages of 3 to 63. With over 22 
					certified Black Belts and 12 Certified 2nd degree black Instructors. 
					located in Oshkosh and Omro Wisconsin. 
					Horizon Martial Arts Officiation included recognition with the World Taekwondo Federation, 
					United Taekwondo do Federation, International Taekwondo federation and the Hapkido federation.

					emphasizing all the aspects of Korean taekwondo, Weapons, Hapkido and Yudo not to be confused with Judo.

					<h2>Technology</h2>
					<p>In the late 80’s I was introduced to the world of technology I found many needs for 
					computers and technology. I was intrigued and curious as to how it all worked from a 
					fundamental need to know. I taught myself all of the basics. Learned the ins and outs of a variety of software application. 
					I still had the need for more. I obtained a contract position with Oshkosh Truck as a desktop publisher which morphed into a 2 year
					contract and promotion to the lead desktop graphic design publisher.</p>
					<p>Technology was exploding, almost a third of the homes in the United states had a PC. 
					Times were great I was building, troubleshooting and networking PC’s. I could not get enough. 
					I started dabbling in all of the above while working at and learning from other techy types…there 
					were no formal programs as that time so the sky was the limit if you could hook up with a store that 
					sold computers you could play with all the technology from the build, troubleshooting, supporting and the 
					networking times where good I had an equal balance of Martial arts and Technology. Then it happened the 
					introduction to the Internet…. thanks to Al Gore ;o) Ha…..I still find that funny. In any case the internet was here. 
					The rest is history. I was obsessed with technology; I could not get enough of it. The more I explored the more I learned, 
					the more I wanted. It was all fresh and new. Everything you needed to know or wanted to know was as the tips of your fingers 
					The internet was the new form of information. I was hooked. </p>

					<h2>Introduction to Cisco</h2>
					<p>I continued to expand my technical skills through hand on job experience and through my continued technical training
					at Madison Area Technical College my program of study was identified as Network security. I was introduced 
					to the world of Cisco Technology which consumed and challenged me. Today I work with Cisco products both Networking and Telecommuunications
					I am currently emmersed in the convergence of the two sides of Cisco, Networking and Cisco CM, Voice and Data VoIP.
